# Day 3 - Goal #

Yesterday, we built a basic application that talks to services running as Azure Web Apps in the cloud. Today, we will enhance the application by introducing modern **Data Storage** services (SQL and NoSQL) and adding features of a modern User Experience, like full-text search. We will also add further services and make sure, that they can loosely communicate with each other, so that the application itself remains easily extendable.

## Architecture ##

At the end of the day, we will have the following architecture up and running in Azure.
