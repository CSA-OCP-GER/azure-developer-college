# What is Azure Cosmos DB?

Azure Cosmos DB:
- is Microsoft's globally distributed, multi-model database service. 
- With a click of a button, Cosmos DB enables you to elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure regions worldwide. 
- You can elastically scale throughput and storage, and take advantage of fast, single-digit-millisecond data access using your favorite API including SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Tables, or Gremlin. 
- Cosmos DB provides comprehensive [service level agreements](https://aka.ms/acdbsla) (SLAs) for throughput, latency, availability, and consistency guarantees, something no other database service offers.

# Create a Cosmos DB via Azure Portal

Create a Cosmos DB:

```
- Create a resource group - "AppDevCollege"
  - westeurope
- Add Cosmos DB
- Create an unique Account Name
- Select API - Core SQL (Apache Spark: None)
- Location: westeurope
- Geo-Redundancy: Disable
- Multi-region Writes: Enable
- Availability Zones: Disable 
- Hit "Create"
```

![Cosmos DB Create Details](./img/CosmosCreateDetails.png)

## Add Data to Cosmos DB ##

- Select Data Explorer from the left navigation on your Azure Cosmos DB account page, and then select New Container.
- In the Add container pane, enter the settings for the new container.
```
  - Database ID: name
  - Throughput: 400
  - Container ID: Items
  - Partition key: id
```
- Hit "Ok"
- In Data Explorer, expand the (name) database, and expand the Items container. Next, select Items, and then select New Item.
- Add the following structure to the document on the right side of the Documents pane:

```
    {
    "id": "1",
    "category": "personal",
    "name": "groceries",
    "description": "Pick up apples and strawberries.",
    "isComplete": false,
    "todoId": "abc-123",
    "date": 2020

    }
```
- Hit "Save"

- Select New Document again, and create and save another document with a unique id, and any other properties and values you   want. Your documents can have any structure, because Azure Cosmos DB doesn't impose any schema on your data.

- At the top of the Documents tab in Data Explorer, review the default query SELECT * FROM c. This query retrieves and displays all documents in the collection in ID order.

- To change the query, select Edit Filter, replace the default query with, and then select Apply Filter.

![Cosmos Data: Create Item](./img/CosmosItemPartition.png)

## Understand Partition Keys ##

Why do we need partitioning?
```
    - Azure Cosmos containers have a minimum throughput of 400 request units per second (RU/s). 
    - When throughput is provisioned on a database, minimum RUs per container is 100 request units per second (RU/s). 
    - Requests to the same partition key can't exceed the throughput that's allocated to a partition. 
    - If requests exceed the allocated throughput, requests are rate-limited. 
    - So, it's important to pick a partition key that doesn't result in "hot spots" within your application.
```
How to choose a partiton key?

Choose a partition key:
```
    - that has a wide range of values and access patterns that are evenly spread across logical partitions. 
    - that spreads the workload evenly across all partitions and evenly over time. 
    - that might include properties that appear frequently as a filter in your queries. 
      Queries can be efficiently routed by including the partition key in the filter predicate.
    - that is a unique Partition Key
```

You can form a partition key by concatenating multiple property values into a single artificial partitionKey property.       These keys are referred to as synthetic keys. 

- For example, consider the following example document:

    ```
        {
        "todoId": "abc-123",
        "date": 2020
        }

    ```
- For the previous document, one option is to set /deviceId or /date as the partition key. Use this option, if you want to   partition your container based on either device ID or date. Another option is to concatenate these two values into a       synthetic partitionKey property that's used as the partition key.

    ```
        {
        "todoId": "abc-123",
        "date": 2020
        "partitionKey": "abc-123-2020"
        }
    ```


# Use ARM Template for automated deployment

- The following Azure Resource Manager template creates an Azure Cosmos account with:
    - Two containers that share 400 Requested Units per second (RU/s) throughput at the database level.
    - One container with dedicated 400 RU/s throughput.

- To create the Azure Cosmos DB resources, copy the following example template and deploy it as described, 
  either via PowerShell or Azure CLI.

- To use Azure CLI to deploy the Azure Resource Manager template:
    
    - Copy the commands below
    - Select Try it to open Azure Cloud Shell.
    - Right-click in the Azure Cloud Shell window, and then select Paste.
```
        az group create --name <InsertRGName> --location westeurope
        az group deployment create --resource-group <InsertRGName> \
        --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-cosmosdb-sql/azuredeploy.json \
        --parameters accountName=<InsertAC-Name> \
        primaryRegion=westeurope \
        secondaryRegion=northeurope \
        databaseName=<InsertName> \
        sharedThroughput=400 \
        sharedContainer1Name=FirstToDo \
        sharedContainer2Name=SecondToDo \
        dedicatedContainer1Name=FirstToDo1 \
        dedicatedThroughput=400

        az cosmosdb show --resource-group <InsertRGName>  --name <InsertACName> --output tsv

```

# Integrate Cosmos DB into Node.JS App

- Open a command prompt, create a new folder named git-samples, then close the command prompt.
```
    md "C:\git-samples"

```
- Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and use the cd command to change to the new folder to install the sample app.
```
    cd "C:\git-samples"
```
- Run the following command to clone the sample repository. This command creates a copy of the sample app on your computer.
```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-sql-api-nodejs-getting-started.git
```
- change into the directory
```
    cd .\azure-cosmos-db-sql-api-nodejs-getting-started\
```
- open Visual Studio Code
```
    code .
```
![Cosmos DB integrated in an App (Visual Studio Code View)](./img/CosmosApp.png)

- Go to Visual Studio Code and open the file app.js

- In app.js: 
    - The CosmosClient object is initialized.
    ```
        const client = new CosmosClient({ endpoint, key });
    ```
    - A new Azure Cosmos database is created.
    ```
        const { database } = await client.databases.createIfNotExists({ id: databaseId });
    ```
    - A new container (collection) is created within the database.
    ```
        const { container } = await client.database(databaseId).containers.createIfNotExists({ id: containerId });
    ```
    - An item (document) is created
    ```
        const { item } = await client.database(databaseId).container(containerId).items.create(itemBody);
    ```

    ![Cosmos DB Client](./img/CosmosAppView2.png)

    - A SQL query over JSON is performed on the family database. The query returns all the children of the "Anderson" family.
    ```
        const querySpec = {
        query: 'SELECT VALUE r.children FROM root r WHERE r.lastName = @lastName',
        parameters: [
        {
            name: '@lastName',
            value: 'Andersen'
        }
        ]
        }
        const { resources: results } = await client
        .database(databaseId)
        .container(containerId)
        .items.query(querySpec)
        .fetchAll()
        for (var queryResult of results) {
        let resultString = JSON.stringify(queryResult)
        console.log(`\tQuery returned ${resultString}\n`)
        }
    ```
    ![Cosmos DB Query](./img/CosmosDBQuery.png)

## Update your connection string ##

- Update your connection string

- In the Azure portal, in your Azure Cosmos account **YourAccountName**, in the left navigation click Keys, and then click Read-write Keys. 
  You'll use the copy buttons on the right side of the screen to copy the URI and Primary Key into the config.js file in the next step.

- Open the config.js file.

- Copy your URI value from the portal (using the copy button) and make it the value of the endpoint key in config.js.

```
  config.endpoint = "https://<FILLME>.documents.azure.com"
```
- Then copy your PRIMARY KEY value from the portal and make it the value of the config.key in config.js. You've now updated      your app with all the info it needs to communicate with Azure Cosmos DB.

```
    config.key = "<FILLME>"
```

- Optionally you can ran npm install and npm start to run the app

# Add Data using Azure Data Factory

## Use (just created) Azure Cosmos DB Database and create a new Container

1. On the left side of the portal, click the **Resource groups** link.
2. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **yourResourceGroup** (which you just created).
3. In the **yourResourceGroup** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.
4. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Overview** link on the left side of the blade. At the top click the **Add Container** button.

5. In the **Add Container** popup, perform the following actions:

    1. In the **Database id** field, select the **Create new** option and enter the value **ImportDatabase**.

    2. Do not check the **Provision database throughput** option.

        > Provisioning throughput for a database allows you to share the throughput among all the containers that belong to that database. Within an Azure Cosmos DB database, you can have a set of containers which shares the throughput as well as containers, which have dedicated throughput.

    3. In the **Container Id** field, enter the value **FoodCollection**.

    4. In the **Partition key** field, enter the value ``/foodGroup``.

    5. In the **Throughput** field, enter the value ``11000``.

    6. Click the **OK** button.

![Cosmos DB: Food Collection](./img/CosmosFoodCollection.png)

6. Wait for the creation of the new **database** and **container** to finish before moving on with this lab.

## Import Lab Data Into Container

You will use **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** to import the JSON array stored in the **nutrition.json** file from Azure Blob Storage. 

1. On the left side of the portal, click the **Resource groups** link.

    > To learn more about copying data to Cosmos DB with ADF, please read [ADF's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-cosmos-db). 

2. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **yourResourceGroup** *Resource Group*.

3. Click **Add** to add a new resource

![Azure Data Factory](./img/DataFactoryCosmos.png)

4. Search for **Data Factory** and select it. Create a new **Data Factory**. You should name this data factory **ImportNutritionDataAppdevColleg(yourname)** with a unique number appended and select the relevant Azure subscription. You should ensure your existing **yourResourceGroup** resource group is selected as well as a Version **V2**. Select **westeurope** as the region. Do **not** select **Enable GIT** (this may be checked by default). Click **create**.

![Data Factory Details](./img/DataFactoryDetails.png)

5. After creation, open your newly created Data Factory. Select **Author & Monitor** and you will launch ADF. You should see a screen similar to the screenshot below. Select **Copy Data**. We will be using ADF for a one-time copy of data from a source JSON file on Azure Blob Storage to a database in Cosmos DB’s SQL API. ADF can also be used for more frequent data transfers from Cosmos DB to other data stores.

![Data Factory Copy Data](./img/CopyDataFactory.png)

6. Edit basic properties for this data copy. You should name the task **ImportNutrition** and select to **Run once now**.

7. **Create a new connection** and select **Azure Blob Storage**. We will import data from a json file on Azure Blob Storage. In addition to Blob Storage, you can use ADF to migrate from a wide variety of sources. We will not cover migration from these sources in this tutorial.


8. Name the source **NutritionJson** and select **SAS URI** as the Authentication method. Please use the following SAS URI for read-only access to this Blob Storage container: 

    `https://cosmosdblabsv3.blob.core.windows.net/?sv=2018-03-28&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rlp&se=2022-01-01T04:55:28Z&st=2019-08-05T20:02:28Z&spr=https&sig=%2FVbismlTQ7INplqo6WfU8o266le72o2bFdZt1Y51PZo%3D`


![Data Source Factory](./img/DataSourceFactory.png)

9. Click **Next** and then **Browse** to select the **nutritiondata** folder. Then select **NutritionData.json**.

![Nutrition JSON](./img/FactoryJSON.png)

10. Do not check **Copy file recursively** or **Binary Copy**. Also ensure that other fields are empty.

11. Select the file format as **JSON format**. Then select **Next**.

![JSON Format](./img/DestinationJSON.png)

12. You have now successfully connected the Blob Storage container with the nutrition.json file as the source.

13. For the **Destination data store** add the Cosmos DB target data store by selecting **Create new connection** and selecting **Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API)**.

14. Name the linked service **targetcosmosdb** and select your Azure subscription and Cosmos DB account. You should also select the Cosmos DB **ImportDatabase** that you created earlier.

15. Select your newly created **targetcosmosdb** connection as the Destination date store.

![Target Cosmos DB](./img/TargetCosmosDB.png)

![Target Cosmos DB](./img/TargetCosmosDB2.png)

16. Select your **FoodCollection** container from the drop-down menu. You will map your Blob storage file to the correct Cosmos DB container. Click **Next** to continue.

17. Click through this screen.

18. There is no need to change any settings. Click **next**.

19. Click **Next** to begin deployment After deployment is complete, select **Monitor**.

20. After a few minutes, refresh the page and the status for the ImportNutrition pipeline should be listed as **Succeeded**.

21. Once the import process has completed, close the ADF. You will now proceed to validate your imported data. 

![Data Factory Success](./img/DataFactorySuccess.png)

## Validate Imported Data

*The Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer allows you to view documents and run queries directly within the Azure Portal. In this exercise, you will use the Data Explorer to view the data stored in our container.*

*You will validate that the data was successfully imported into your container using the **Items** view in the **Data Explorer**.*

1. Return to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>).

2. On the left side of the portal, click the **Resource groups** link.

3. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **yourResourceGroup** *Resource Group*.

4. In the **yourResourceGroup** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.

5. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.

6. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **ImportDatabase** database node and then expand the **FoodCollection** container node. 

7. Within the **FoodCollection** node, click the **Items** link to view a subset of the various documents in the container. Select a few of the documents and observe the properties and structure of the documents.

![Data Explorer](./img/FoodCollectionDatafactory.png)

# Querying and Indexing in Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB SQL API accounts provide support for querying items using the Structured Query Language (SQL), one of the most familiar and popular query languages, as a JSON query language. In this lab, you will explore how to use these rich query capabilities directly through the Azure Portal. No separate tools or client side code are required.

## Query Overview

Querying JSON with SQL allows Azure Cosmos DB to combine the advantages of a legacy relational databases with a NoSQL database. You can use many rich query capabilities such as subqueries or aggregation functions but still retain the many advantages of modeling data in a NoSQL database.

Azure Cosmos DB supports strict JSON items only. The type system and expressions are restricted to deal only with JSON types. For more information, see the [JSON specification](https://www.json.org/).

## Running your first query

You will begin by running basic queries with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses.

### Open Data Explorer

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.
2. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **NutritionDatabase** database node and then expand the **FoodCollection** container node.
3. Within the **FoodCollection** node, click the **Items** link.
4. View the items within the container. Observe how these documents have many properties, including arrays.
5. Click **New SQL Query**. Paste the following SQL query and select **Execute Query**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM food
WHERE food.foodGroup = "Snacks" and food.id = "19015"
```

6. You will see that the query returned the single document where id is "19015" and the foodGroup is "Snacks".
7. Explore the structure of this item as it is representative of the items within the **FoodCollection** container that we will be working with for the remainder of this section.

![Food Query](./img/FoodQuery.png)

## Dot and quoted property projection accessors

You can choose which properties of the document to project into the result using the dot notation. If you wanted to return only the item's id you could run the query below:
by clicking the **New SQL Query**. Paste the following SQL query and selecting **Execute Query**.

```sql
SELECT food.id
FROM food
WHERE food.foodGroup = "Snacks" and food.id = "19015"
```
![Food Query](./img/FoodQuery2.png)

Though less common, you can also access properties using the quoted property operator [""]. For example, SELECT food.id and SELECT food["id"] are equivalent. This syntax is useful to escape a property that contains spaces, special characters, or has the same name as a SQL keyword or reserved word.

```sql
SELECT food["id"]
FROM food
WHERE food["foodGroup"] = "Snacks" and food["id"] = "19015"
```
![Food Query](./img/FoodQuery3.png)

## WHERE clauses

Let’s explore WHERE clauses. You can add complex scalar expressions including arithmetic, comparison and logical operators in the WHERE clause.

1. Run the below query by clicking the **New SQL Query**. Paste the following SQL query and then click **Execute Query**.

```sql
SELECT food.id,
food.description,
food.tags,
food.foodGroup,
food.version
FROM food
WHERE (food.manufacturerName = "The Coca-Cola Company" AND food.version > 0)
```
![Where Clause](./img/FoodWhere.png)

This query will return the id, description, servings, tags, foodGroup, manufacturerName and version for items with "The Coca-Cola Company" for manufacturerName and a version greater than 0.

Your first result document should be:

```json
{
  "id": "14026",
  "description": "Beverages, Energy Drink, sugar-free with guarana",
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "beverages"
    },
    {
      "name": "energy drink"
    },
    {
      "name": "sugar-free with guarana"
    }
  ],
  "foodGroup": "Beverages",
  "manufacturerName": "The Coca-Cola Company",
  "version": 1
}
```

You should note that where the query returned the results of tags node it projected the entire contents of the property which in this case is an array.

## Advanced projection

Azure Cosmos DB supports several forms of transformation on the resultant JSON. One of the simplest is to alias your JSON elements using the AS aliasing keyword as you project your results.

By running the query below you will see that the element names are transformed. In addition, the projection is accessing only the first element in the servings array for all items specified by the WHERE clause.

```sql
SELECT food.description,
food.foodGroup,
food.servings[0].description AS servingDescription,
food.servings[0].weightInGrams AS servingWeight
FROM food
WHERE food.foodGroup = "Fruits and Fruit Juices"
AND food.servings[0].description = "cup"
```

![Where Clause](./img/FoodWhere2.png)

## ORDER BY clause

Azure Cosmos DB supports adding an ORDER BY clause to sort results based on one or more properties

```sql
SELECT food.description, 
food.foodGroup, 
food.servings[0].description AS servingDescription,
food.servings[0].weightInGrams AS servingWeight
FROM food
WHERE food.foodGroup = "Fruits and Fruit Juices" AND food.servings[0].description = "cup"
ORDER BY food.servings[0].weightInGrams DESC
```
![Oder By Query](./img/OrderBy.png)

You can learn more about configuring the required indexes for an Order By clause in the later Indexing Lab or by reading [our docs](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-query-order-by).

## Limiting query result size

Azure Cosmos DB supports the TOP keyword. TOP can be used to limit the number of returning values from a query.
Run the query below to see the top 20 results.

```sql
SELECT TOP 20 food.id,
food.description,
food.tags,
food.foodGroup
FROM food
WHERE food.foodGroup = "Snacks"
```

The OFFSET LIMIT clause is an optional clause to skip then take some number of values from the query. The OFFSET count and the LIMIT count are required in the OFFSET LIMIT clause.

```sql
SELECT food.id,
food.description,
food.tags,
food.foodGroup
FROM food
WHERE food.foodGroup = "Snacks"
ORDER BY food.id
OFFSET 10 LIMIT 10
```

![Food Query](./img/FoodQuery4.png)

When OFFSET LIMIT is used in conjunction with an ORDER BY clause, the result set is produced by doing skip and take on the ordered values. If no ORDER BY clause is used, it will result in a deterministic order of values.

## More advanced filtering

Let’s add the IN and BETWEEN keywords into our queries. IN can be used to check whether a specified value matches any element in a given list and BETWEEN can be used to run queries against a range of values. Run some sample queries below:

```sql
SELECT food.id,
       food.description,
       food.tags,
       food.foodGroup,
       food.version
FROM food
WHERE food.foodGroup IN ("Poultry Products", "Sausages and Luncheon Meats")
    AND (food.id BETWEEN "05740" AND "07050")
```

![Food Query](./img/FoodQuery5.png)

## More advanced projection

Azure Cosmos DB supports JSON projection within its queries. Let’s project a new JSON Object with modified property names. Run the query below to see the results.

```sql
SELECT { 
"Company": food.manufacturerName,
"Brand": food.commonName,
"Serving Description": food.servings[0].description,
"Serving in Grams": food.servings[0].weightInGrams,
"Food Group": food.foodGroup 
} AS Food
FROM food
WHERE food.id = "21421"
```
![Food Query](./img/FoodQuery6.png)

## JOIN within your documents

Azure Cosmos DB’s JOIN supports intra-document and self-joins. Azure Cosmos DB does not support JOINs across documents or containers.

In an earlier query example we returned a result with attributes of just the first serving of the food.servings array. By using the join syntax below, we can now return an item in the result for every item within the serving array while still being able to project the attributes from elsewhere in the item.

Run the query below to iterate on the food document’s servings.

```sql
SELECT
food.id as FoodID,
serving.description as ServingDescription
FROM food
JOIN serving IN food.servings
WHERE food.id = "03226"
```
![Food Query](./img/FoodQuery7.png)

JOINs are useful if you need to filter on properties within an array. Run the below example that has filter after the intra-document JOIN.

```sql
SELECT VALUE COUNT(1)
FROM c
JOIN t IN c.tags
JOIN s IN c.servings
WHERE t.name = 'infant formula' AND s.amount > 1
```
![Food Query](./img/FoodQuery8.png)

## System functions

Azure Cosmos DB supports a number of built-in functions for common operations. They cover mathematical functions like ABS, FLOOR and ROUND and type checking functions like IS_ARRAY, IS_BOOL and IS_DEFINED. [Learn more about supported system functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-query-system-functions).

Run the query below to see example use of some system functions

```sql
SELECT food.id,
food.commonName,
food.foodGroup,
ROUND(nutrient.nutritionValue) AS amount,
nutrient.units
FROM food JOIN nutrient IN food.nutrients
WHERE IS_DEFINED(food.commonName)
AND nutrient.description = "Water"
AND food.foodGroup IN ("Sausages and Luncheon Meats", "Legumes and Legume Products")
AND food.id > "42178"
```

![Food Query](./img/FoodQuery9.png)

## Correlated subqueries

In many scenarios, a subquery may be effective. A correlated subquery is a query that references values from an outer query. We will walk through some of the most useful examples here. You can [learn more about subqueries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-query-subquery).

There are two types of subqueries: Multi-value subqueries and scalar subqueries. Multi-value subqueries return a set of documents and are always used within the FROM clause. A scalar subquery expression is a subquery that evaluates to a single value.

### Multi-value subqueries

You can optimize JOIN expressions with a subquery.

Consider the following query which performs a self-join and then applies a filter on name, nutritionValue, and amount. We can use a subquery to filter out the joined array items before joining with the next expression.

```sql
SELECT VALUE COUNT(1)
FROM c
JOIN t IN c.tags
JOIN n IN c.nutrients
JOIN s IN c.servings
WHERE t.name = 'infant formula' AND (n.nutritionValue > 0 
AND n.nutritionValue < 10) AND s.amount > 1
```
![Food Query](./img/FoodQuery10.png)

Let's look at the Request Unit Statistics:

![Query Statistics](./img/QueryStatshigh.png)

We could rewrite this query using three subqueries to optimize and reduce the Request Unit (RU) charge. Observe that the multi-value subquery always appears in the FROM clause of the outer query.

```sql
SELECT VALUE COUNT(1)
FROM c
JOIN (SELECT VALUE t FROM t IN c.tags WHERE t.name = 'infant formula')
JOIN (SELECT VALUE n FROM n IN c.nutrients WHERE n.nutritionValue > 0 AND n.nutritionValue < 10)
JOIN (SELECT VALUE s FROM s IN c.servings WHERE s.amount > 1)
```

![Food Query](./img/FoodQuery11.png)

Let's compare the Request Unit Statistics:

![Query Statistics](./img/QueryStatslow.png)

You should observe a lower Request Unit charge.

## Indexing in Azure Cosmos DB

In this lab, you will modify the indexing policy of an Azure Cosmos DB container. You will explore how you can optimize indexing policy for write or read heavy workloads as well as understand the indexing requirements for different SQL API query features.

## Indexing Overview

Azure Cosmos DB is a schema-agnostic database that allows you to iterate on your application without having to deal with schema or index management. By default, Azure Cosmos DB automatically indexes every property for all items in your container without the need to define any schema or configure secondary indexes. If you chose to leave indexing policy at the default settings, you can run most queries with optimal performance and never have to explicitly consider indexing. However, if you want control over adding or removing properties from the index, modification is possible through the Azure Portal or any SQL API SDK.

Azure Cosmos DB uses an inverted index, representing your data in a tree form. For a brief introduction on how this works, read our [indexing overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/index-overview) before continuing with the lab.

## Customizing the indexing policy

In this lab section, you will view and modify the indexing policy for your **FoodCollection**.

### Open Data Explorer

1. On the left side of the portal, click the **Resource groups** link.

2. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **yourResourceGroup** *Resource Group*.

3. In the **yourResourceGroup** blade, select your **Azure Cosmos DB** account.

4. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.

5. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **NutritionDatabase** database node and then expand the **FoodCollection** container node.

6. Within the **FoodCollection** node, click the **Items** link.

7. View the items within the container. Observe how these documents have many properties, including arrays. If we do not use a particular property in the WHERE clause, ORDER BY clause, or a JOIN, indexing the property does not provide any performance benefit.

8. Still within the **FoodCollection** node, click the **Scale & Settings** link. In the **Indexing Policy** section, you can edit the JSON file that defines your container's index. Indexing policy can also be modified through any Azure Cosmos DB SDK, but during this lab we will modify the indexing policy through the Azure Portal.

### Including and excluding Range Indexes

Instead of including a range index on every property by default, you can chose to either include or exclude specific paths from the index. Let's go through some simple examples (no need to enter these into the Azure Portal, we can just review them here).

Within the **FoodCollection**, documents have this schema (some properties were removed for simplicity):

```json
{
    "id": "36000",
    "_rid": "LYwNAKzLG9ADAAAAAAAAAA==",
    "_self": "dbs/LYwNAA==/colls/LYwNAKzLG9A=/docs/LYwNAKzLG9ADAAAAAAAAAA==/",
    "_etag": "\"0b008d85-0000-0700-0000-5d1a47e60000\"",
    "description": "APPLEBEE'S, 9 oz house sirloin steak",
    "tags": [
        {
            "name": "applebee's"
        },
        {
            "name": "9 oz house sirloin steak"
        }
    ],

    "manufacturerName": "Applebee's",
    "foodGroup": "Restaurant Foods",
    "nutrients": [
        {
            "id": "301",
            "description": "Calcium, Ca",
            "nutritionValue": 16,
            "units": "mg"
        },
        {
            "id": "312",
            "description": "Copper, Cu",
            "nutritionValue": 0.076,
            "units": "mg"
        },
    ]
}
```

If you wanted to only index the manufacturerName, foodGroup, and nutrients array with a range index, you should define the following index policy:

```json
{
        "indexingMode": "consistent",
        "includedPaths": [
            {
                "path": "/manufacturerName/*"
            },
            {
                "path": "/foodGroup/*"
            },
            {
                "path": "/nutrients/[]/*"
            }
        ],
        "excludedPaths": [
            {
                "path": "/*"
            }
        ]
    }
```

![Index Policy](./img/IndexPolicy.png)

In this example, we use the wildcard character '*' to indicate that we would like to index all paths within the nutrients array. However, it's possible we may just want to index the nutritionValue of each array element.

In this next example, the indexing policy would explicitly specify that the nutritionValue path in the nutrition array should be indexed. Since we don't use the wildcard character '*', no additional paths in the array are indexed.

```json
{
        "indexingMode": "consistent",
        "includedPaths": [
            {
                "path": "/manufacturerName/*"
            },
            {
                "path": "/foodGroup/*"
            },
            {
                "path": "/nutrients/[]/nutritionValue/*"
            }
        ],
        "excludedPaths": [
            {
                "path": "/*"
            }
        ]
    }
```

Finally, it's important to understand the difference between the `*` and `?` characters. The `*` character indicates that Azure Cosmos DB should index every path beyond that specific node. The `?` character indicates that Azure Cosmos DB should index no further paths beyond this node. In the above example, there are no additional paths under nutritionValue. If we were to modify the document and add a path here, having the wildcard character '*'  in the above example would ensure that the property is indexed without explicitly mentioning the name.

### Understand query requirements

Before modifying indexing policy, it's important to understand how the data is used the collection. If your workload is write-heavy or your documents are large, you should only index necessary paths. This will significantly decrease the amount of RU's required for inserts, updates, and deletes.

Let's imagine that the following queries are the only read operations that are executed on the **FoodCollection** container.

**Query #1**

```sql
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.manufacturerName = <manufacturerName>
```

**Query #2**

```sql
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.foodGroup = <foodGroup>
```

These queries only require that a range index be defined on **manufacturerName** and **foodGroup**, respectively. We can modify the indexing policy to index only these properties.

### Edit the indexing policy by including paths

1. Navigate back to the **FoodCollection** in the Azure Portal and click the **Scale & Settings** link. In the **Indexing Policy** section, replace the existing json file with the following:

```json
{
        "indexingMode": "consistent",
        "includedPaths": [
            {
                "path": "/manufacturerName/*"
            },
            {
                "path": "/foodGroup/*"
            }
        ],
        "excludedPaths": [
            {
                "path": "/*"
            }
        ]
    }
```

This new indexing policy will create a range index on only the manufacturerName and foodGroup properties. It will remove range indexes on all other properties. Click **Save**. Azure Cosmos DB will update the index in the container, using your excess provisioned throughput to make the updates.

During the container re-indexing, write performance is unaffected. However, queries may return incomplete results.

1. After defining the new indexing policy, navigate to your **FoodCollection** and select the **Add New SQL Query** icon. Paste the following SQL query and select **Execute Query**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.manufacturerName = "Kellogg, Co."
```

![Query](./img/QueryKellog.png)

Let's look at the Request Unit Statistics:

![Query Statistics](./img/QueryStatsIndexLow.png)

Navigate to the **Query Stats** tab. You should observe that this query still has a low RU charge, even after removing some properties from the index. Because the **manufacturerName** was the only property used as a filter in the query, it was the only index that was required.

Now, replace the query text with the following and select **Execute Query**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.description = "Bread, blue corn, somiviki (Hopi)"
```
![Query](./img/QueryCorn.png)

Let's compare the Request Unit Statistics:

![Query Statistics](./img/QueryStatsIndexHigh.png)

You should observe that this query has a very high RU charge even though only a single document is returned. This is because no range index is currently defined for the `description` property.

If a query does not use the index, the **Index hit document count** will be 0. We can see above that the query needed to retrieve 5,187 documents and ultimately ended up only returning 1 document.

### Edit the indexing policy by excluding paths

In addition to manually including certain paths to be indexed, you can exclude specific paths. In many cases, this approach can be simpler since it will allow all new properties in your document to be indexed by default. If there is a property that you are certain you will never use in your queries, you should explicitly exclude this path.

### Use Azure CLI to Delete Resource Group

1. In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press **Enter** to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```sh
    az group list
    ```

2. Type in the following command and press **Enter** to delete the **yourResourceGroup** *Resource Group*:

    ```sh
    az group delete --name "yourResourceGroup" --no-wait --yes
    ```

3. Close the **Cloud Shell** prompt at the bottom of the portal.

4. Close your browser application.
